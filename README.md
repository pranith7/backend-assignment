Hey Rohit,

I just want to thank u for the opportunity for giving me a chance  and i want 
to you inform you that i have not implemented chat session feature that u have asked me to but below are my learnings in the past 2-3 days of building this project.

1. Understood that i need to be a quick thinker and learner whenver we have limited access to implement.

2. Instead of going & building hi-fi features from the start build a basic prototype and add feature's incrementally until it becomes close to ur visioned prototype.

3. U need to have a boiler plate code for all the common services with ready to fucntinoalties written and just need to tweak a little bit according to your project.

4. I will implement the learnings that i found in this project in building my own django-bot which can read the documentation of multiple sister websites of django libraires and the official documentation.

```
